\begin{enumerate}
    \item An electron is found to be in the spin state (in the z basis):   $\chi$ = A $\begin{pmatrix} 3i  \\ 4  \end{pmatrix}$
        \item[\ding{32}] (a) (5 Points) Determine the possible values of A such that the state is normalized.                        
        \item[\ding{32}] (b) (5 Points) Find the expectation values of the operators  {\color{red}$S_{x}$}, {\color{purple}$S_{y}$}, {\color{orange}$S_{z}$} and $\overrightarrow{S}^{2}$.   
        \item[\ding{32}] The matrix representation in the z-basis for the components of electron spin operators are given by:
        \item[\ding{32}] {\color{red}{$S_{x}$ = $\frac{\hbar}{2}$ $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1  \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$}}; \hspace{1cm}{\color{purple}{$S_{y}$ = $\frac{\hbar}{2}$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i  \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$}}; \hspace{1cm} {\color{orange}{$S_{z}$ = $\frac{\hbar}{2}$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$}}
    \item The average electrostatic field in the earth's atmosphere in fair weather is approximately given:

\begin{equation}{\overrightarrow{E}=E_{0}(Ae^{-\alpha z}+Be^{-\beta z})\hat{z},}\end{equation}

    \item[\ding{32}]where A,B,$\alpha$,$\beta$ are positive constants and z is the height above the (locally flat) earth surface.
    \item[\ding{32}](a) (5 points) Find the average charge density in the atmosphere as a function of height
    \item[\ding{32}](b) (5 points) Find the electric potential as a function height above the earth. 

    \item {\bf The following questions refer to stars in the Table below.} \\ Note: There may be multiple answers.
